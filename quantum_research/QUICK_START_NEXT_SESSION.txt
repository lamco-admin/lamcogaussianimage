QUANTUM RESEARCH - NEXT SESSION QUICK START
============================================

1. READ THIS FIRST:
   HANDOVER_SESSION_2025_12_04_05_COMPLETE.md
   
   This explains EVERYTHING from the 18-hour session.

2. CLEAN STATE:
   - No processes running
   - 73GB RAM free
   - All data collected and saved

3. ONE CLEAR ACTIONABLE FINDING:
   Isotropic edges work better (+1.87 dB validated on 5 images)
   
   Implementation: encode_error_driven_adam_isotropic() exists
   Location: packages/lgi-rs/lgi-encoder-v2/src/lib.rs:744-888

4. KEY DATA FILES:
   - kodak_gaussian_data/*.csv (682K trajectories)
   - gaussian_channels_kodak_quantum.json (8 quantum channels)
   - kodak_gaussians_quantum_ready_enhanced.pkl (10D features)

5. WHAT DIDN'T WORK:
   - Quantum clustering (silhouette 0.009 vs classical 0.547)
   - Running multiple experiments simultaneously (crashes)
   - 1,483+ samples (OOM crashes)

6. BEFORE STARTING NEW WORK:
   - Decide: What's the primary goal?
   - Choose: Quantum or classical clustering?
   - Pick: ONE focused experiment

7. DON'T:
   - Run multiple things at once
   - Try to use quantum without clear hypothesis
   - Proceed without reading handover

READ HANDOVER FIRST. It explains everything.
